---

## Setup

```bash
cd lab02
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify everything is working:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

(All tests should be collected but show as `passed` — they're stubs with `pass`.)

---

## Part 1 — Mocking HTTP & DB (10 min)

**File:** `tests/test_process_order.py`

Open `order_processor.py` and look at `process_order()`. It has **5 code paths**:

| # | Condition | Expected `status` |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Invalid order (no items) | `"invalid"` |
| 2 | DB save fails | `"error"` |
| 3 | Payment succeeds | `"ok"` |
| 4 | Payment HTTP error (402) | `"payment_failed"` |
| 5 | Payment timeout | `"payment_timeout"` |

### Your task

Fill in the 5 test methods in `tests/test_process_order.py` to cover all paths.

**Key techniques:**
- `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `requests.post` for the payment API
- In-memory SQLite (`:memory:`) for the DB — `save_order` accepts a `conn` parameter
- Create the `orders` table in your test setup

**Try with Copilot:** Open the test file and use **Copilot Chat** → ask it to help implement each test.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

- Patch at the import location: `@patch("order_processor.requests.post")` not `@patch("requests.post")`
- For `raise_for_status` on 402: `mock_resp.raise_for_status.side_effect = requests.HTTPError("402")`
- For timeout: `mock_post.side_effect = requests.Timeout()`

</details>

### Verify

```bash
pytest tests/test_process_order.py -v
```

---

## Part 2 — Fixtures & Parametrize (15 min)

**Files:** `tests/test_validation.py` + `tests/conftest.py`

`validate_order()` has **8+ conditions**. Writing 8 separate test functions is tedious — use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` instead.

### Your tasks

1. **Fixture factory:** Move the `make_order` fixture into `conftest.py` so it's shared across all test files. The fixture should return a *function* (factory pattern), not an object.

2. **Parametrized tests:** In `test_validation.py`, use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to test all these cases in ONE test function:

   | `order_kwargs` | Expected error substring |
   |---|---|
   | `order_id=""` | `"order_id is required"` |
   | `order_id="   "` | `"order_id is required"` |
   | `customer_email="no-at"` | `"customer_email is invalid"` |
   | `customer_email=""` | `"customer_email is invalid"` |
   | `items=[]` | `"at least one item"` |
   | `discount_pct=-5` | `"between 0 and 100"` |
   | `discount_pct=101` | `"between 0 and 100"` |

3. **Boundary tests:** Verify that `discount_pct=0` and `discount_pct=100` are VALID (no errors).

4. **Item-level validation:** Test `quantity <= 0` and `unit_price < 0`.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

- Fixture factory: the fixture returns a function, not an object
- For boundary tests (discount=0, discount=100): these should return empty error list
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize("order_kwargs,expected_errors", [...])`

</details>

### Verify

```bash
pytest tests/test_validation.py -v
```

---

## Part 3 — Async with AsyncMock (15 min)

**File:** `tests/test_notify.py`

`notify_customer()` is fully async with `aiohttp`. This forces you to use `AsyncMock` and `pytest-asyncio`.

### Your tasks

1. **Successful notification:** Mock the session, set `status = 200`, assert `True`
2. **Non-200 response:** Set `status = 500`, assert `False`
3. **Network error:** Set `side_effect = aiohttp.ClientError()`, assert `False`

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

- `AsyncMock` is in `unittest.mock` from Python 3.8+
- Mock the context manager: `mock_session.post.return_value.__aenter__.return_value.status = 200`
- Use `assert_awaited_once_with()` not `assert_called_once_with()` for async

</details>

### Verify

```bash
pytest tests/test_notify.py -v
```

---

## Part 4 — Coverage Gap Fill with Agent Mode (10 min)

Now let's see how much coverage you have:

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=order_processor --cov-report=term-missing -v
```

### Your tasks

1. **Read the report** — which lines/functions are still uncovered?
2. **Use Copilot Agent Mode** (VS Code) — open Agent Mode and prompt:
   > "Run pytest with coverage, identify uncovered lines in order_processor.py, and write tests to cover them."
3. **Or use the CLI task agent:**
   ```bash
   gh copilot task "Run pytest --cov on this project, find uncovered lines, and add tests"
   ```
4. Re-run coverage and aim for **80%+**

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

- If Agent Mode stops early, re-prompt: "Continue — run pytest again and fix remaining failures"
- Likely uncovered: `load_order()`, `charge_customer()` standalone, `Order.subtotal`/`total` properties, `get_db_connection()`

</details>

---

## Part 5 — CI Coverage Gate + Agentic Workflows (10 min)

### 5a: Coverage gate in CI

If your repo has a `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, look for the `--cov-fail-under=80` flag — this makes the CI job **fail** if coverage drops below 80%. (If you don't have one yet, just test the flag locally.)

```bash
# Test it locally:
pytest tests/ --cov=order_processor --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80 -v
```

If it fails, go back and add more tests until you pass the gate.

### 5b: Agentic Workflows (bonus)

If your repo has a `.github/workflows/improve-tests.md`, this is a GitHub Agentic Workflow definition that automatically finds and fills coverage gaps. (This file is not included in the lab — you can create one as an exercise.)

To try it locally (requires `gh` CLI):

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-aw
gh aw compile .github/workflows/improve-tests.md
gh aw run improve-tests
```

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

- `--cov-fail-under=80` exits with code 2 if coverage is below threshold
- The Agentic Workflow needs `gh extension install github/gh-aw` to compile and run locally

</details>

---

## Part 6 — GitHub Copilot CLI for Testing (10 min)

So far you've used Copilot inside VS Code. Now let's use it **from the terminal** with the GitHub CLI.

### Setup

```bash
# Install the Copilot CLI extension (requires gh CLI)
gh extension install github/gh-copilot

# Verify
gh copilot --help
```

### 6a: Explain — understand unfamiliar test patterns (2 min)

Use `gh copilot explain` to understand code without leaving the terminal:

```bash
gh copilot explain "What does @patch('order_processor.requests.post') do and why not @patch('requests.post')?"
```

Try another:

```bash
gh copilot explain "What does mock_session.post.return_value.__aenter__.return_value.status = 200 mean in Python?"
```

**When to use:** Onboarding to a new codebase, understanding unfamiliar patterns, quick reference.

### 6b: Suggest — get the right command (3 min)

You know *what* you want but not the exact command:

```bash
# How do I run only tests that failed last time?
gh copilot suggest "run only previously failed pytest tests"

# How do I see coverage for just one function?
gh copilot suggest "run pytest coverage for only the validate_order function in order_processor.py"

# How do I create a PR from the terminal?
gh copilot suggest "create a draft pull request titled 'Add unit tests' from current branch"
```

Copilot will ask you to pick the command type (shell, git, or gh) then generate the exact command. You can run it directly.

### 6c: Task — autonomous test generation (5 min)

`gh copilot task` is the CLI equivalent of Agent Mode. Give it a goal and it works autonomously:

**Step 1:** Check your current coverage gaps:

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=order_processor --cov-report=term-missing -v
```

**Step 2:** Ask Copilot to fill them:

```bash
gh copilot task "Look at lab02/order_processor.py. The functions load_order() and charge_customer() need direct unit tests. Write them in lab02/tests/test_cli_generated.py using in-memory SQLite for DB and unittest.mock.patch for HTTP calls."
```

**Step 3:** Verify the generated tests pass:

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=order_processor --cov-report=term-missing -v
```

**Step 4:** If coverage is still below target, iterate:

```bash
gh copilot task "Coverage is still below 80%. Check the remaining uncovered lines and add tests."
```

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

- `explain` is best for understanding patterns — give it a specific code snippet or concept
- `suggest` asks you to pick shell/git/gh command type — pick "shell" for pytest commands
- `task` works best with specific, well-scoped instructions — include file paths and function names
- If `task` output isn't right, refine your prompt with more context

</details>

## Part 7 — E2E Testing with MCP Servers (15 min)

So far you've tested at the **unit level** — mocking dependencies and testing functions in isolation. Now let's go beyond unit tests using **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** to run **end-to-end browser tests** and **API tests** directly from Agent Mode.

### What is MCP?

MCP servers give Copilot **tools** it can call — like opening a browser, clicking buttons, or making HTTP requests. For testing, this means the agent can interact with a running application just like a real user.

### Setup

1. **Install Playwright MCP:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic/playwright-mcp
   ```

2. **Configure in VS Code:** Add to your `.vscode/mcp.json` (or user settings):
   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "servers": {
         "playwright": {
           "command": "npx",
           "args": ["@anthropic/playwright-mcp@latest"]
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart VS Code** and verify Playwright appears in Agent Mode's tool list (look for the tools icon).

### 7a: Discover available MCP tools (2 min)

Switch to **Agent Mode** and ask:

```
What Playwright MCP tools do you have available? List them briefly.
```

You should see tools like `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_type`, etc. These are the building blocks for browser-based testing.

### 7b: Exploratory API testing with Playwright MCP (5 min)

`order_processor.py` has HTTP calls to a payment API. Let's use MCP to test an API endpoint interactively.

Ask Agent Mode:

```
Use Playwright MCP to navigate to https://httpbin.org/post and take a snapshot.
Then explain what this endpoint does and how I could use it
as a mock payment API for testing order_processor.py.
```

**What to observe:**
- The agent calls `browser_navigate` → `browser_snapshot` in sequence
- Snapshots return an **accessibility tree** (text-based), not a screenshot — ideal for AI analysis
- The agent can reason about what it sees and suggest testing strategies

### 7c: E2E test flow with MCP (5 min)

Now let's combine MCP with the code you already tested. Ask Agent Mode:

```
I want to verify my order processing system works end-to-end.

1. Use Playwright MCP to make a POST request to https://httpbin.org/post
   with a JSON body: {"order_id": "ORD-001", "amount": 99.99}
2. Take a snapshot of the response page
3. Verify the response shows the data was received correctly
4. Based on this, write a pytest test in tests/test_e2e_mcp.py that
   uses httpbin.org as a real payment endpoint (no mocking)
   to test process_order() with a live HTTP call
```

**Key insight:** MCP lets you **explore first, codify later**. The agent discovers how the API behaves interactively, then generates repeatable pytest tests from its findings.

### 7d: Accessibility audit (3 min)

Playwright MCP's snapshot returns an accessibility tree — making it a natural **accessibility auditing tool**. Try it on any web page:

```
Use Playwright MCP to navigate to https://example.com and take a snapshot.
Analyze the accessibility tree:
- Is there a proper heading hierarchy?
- Are all links descriptive?
- Are ARIA roles used correctly?
List any issues.
```

### Adding more MCP servers (optional)

You can extend your testing toolkit with additional MCP servers:

| MCP Server | Use Case | Install |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `@anthropic/playwright-mcp` | Browser E2E & a11y testing | `npx @anthropic/playwright-mcp@latest` |
| `@anthropic/fetch-mcp` | Dedicated HTTP/API testing | `npx @anthropic/fetch-mcp@latest` |

To add **Fetch MCP**, add to your MCP config:
```json
{
  "fetch": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@anthropic/fetch-mcp@latest"]
  }
}
```

Then ask Agent Mode:
```
Use the fetch tool to POST to https://httpbin.org/post with
{"test": true} and verify the response.
```

### Takeaway

MCP servers turn Agent Mode into a **full testing platform**:
- **Explore** interactively with browser/API tools
- **Discover** bugs and edge cases in real time
- **Generate** repeatable pytest tests from findings
- **Verify** fixes immediately through the same tools

This is the **explore → find → codify** pattern — use MCP for discovery, then lock it down as automated tests.

## Solutions

Solutions for each part are in the `solutions/` folder:
- `solutions/test_process_order_solution.py` — Part 1
- `solutions/conftest_solution.py` — Part 2 (shared fixtures)
- `solutions/test_validation_solution.py` — Part 2
- `solutions/test_notify_solution.py` — Part 3

---

## Trainer Notes

- The starter code is intentionally injectable — all external deps (DB, HTTP, async session) accept optional parameters so they're easy to mock without monkeypatching globals
- `process_order()` has 5 distinct code paths — ideal for Part 1
- `validate_order()` has 8+ conditions — ideal for parametrize in Part 2
- `notify_customer()` is fully async with aiohttp — forces use of AsyncMock in Part 3
- `.github/workflows/improve-tests.md` is referenced as a GitHub Agentic Workflow definition — participants can create one as a bonus exercise
- `datetime.datetime.now()` in `Order.__post_init__` is an intentional testability trap — ask participants how they'd mock it (answer: inject `created_at` explicitly in tests, or monkeypatch `datetime.datetime`)
